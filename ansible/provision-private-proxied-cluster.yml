# Creates a TLS enabled cluster with tiered storage using a local CA in tls/ca for testing purposes
# More information about tiered storage available here: https://docs.redpanda.com/docs/manage/tiered-storage/
# !!! WARNING !!!
# If you intend to use this for a production cluster you will need to set handle_certs to false and provide your own certs
# Using our demo certificate authority for production is not recommended, and is intended only for testing and proof of concepts.
# Redpanda encourages you to integrate with your corporate certificate management setup.
# variables
# root_ca_dir: location of our demo cert authority
# handle_certs: when false, disables all activity related to our demo CA
# enable_tls: when true, adds the tls template to the /etc/redpanda/redpanda.yml file
# advertise_public_ips : causes the cluster to set a public ip on advertised_kafka_api, allowing access to the cluster from the public internet
